Develop a Next.js application that takes the Markdown content of a scraped modern one-page website and transforms its design to reflect 90s web aesthetics. The transformation includes modifying layouts, color schemes, fonts, and ensuring compatibility with 90s-era web technologies.

[Technologies Used]:

Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for static type checking.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Markdown: Format of the input content to be transformed.

[Challenge]:
Develop a system to analyze modern web designs and convert them to 90s aesthetics. 

[Key Tasks]:
Transform layouts to reflect 90s design patterns
Convert modern color schemes to 90s-appropriate palettes
Replace modern fonts with period-appropriate alternatives
Ensure compatibility with 90s-era web technologies

[Return]:
As an output only return the full code that will be placed inside ".tsx" file. Return only the code, full implementation.
