                        <b>Scientific Rigor In Hackathons: Applying Efficient Methods For Robust Results</b>
                    </font>
                    <p>
                        Hackathons are growing in popularity in the fast-paced world because they offer learning opportunities. They can influence creativity, innovation, and problem-solving skills to help in tech-driven projects. But do they provide reliable solutions in hours or days? Because of the project’s speed, the team sacrifices precision and quality, offering short-term results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why you see the lack of depth or scientific rigor in Hackathon. Various hackathon types, such as healthcare, require thorough research and factual data for validation. So, you need a structural and scientific approach to achieve robust results in a constrained time.

                        <b>Challenges of Maintaining Scientific Rigor</b>
                    </font>
                    <p>Maintaining scientific rigor in Hackathon is challenging in the fast-paced, competitive environment. So, what factors can restrict reliable plans or methodologies for the hackathon? These include time constraints, less skill, or limited resources as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Time Constraints</b> - Detailed analysis and research are required to apply scientific rigor; which doesn’t align with the fast nature of hackathons.</li>
                        <li><b>Pressure to Innovate</b> - The theme and nature of hackathons encourage creativity, but under pressure, scientific rigor can be overshadowed.</li>
                        <li><b>Resource Limitations</b> - Lack of access to essential resources like datasets and expertise can hinder scientifically valid solutions.</li>
                        <li><b>Team Composition and Expertise</b> - Expertise in scientific research for factual data is crucial for robust results.</li>
                        <li><b>Short-Term Focus</b> - Many teams focus on short-term success rather than long-term sustainability and real-time analysis.</li>
                        <li><b>Complex Problem-Solving in Limited Time</b> - The setting and lack of research expertise make complex problem-solving challenging.</li>
