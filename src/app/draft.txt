idea is very simple. when we crawl the website, 
we will save each crawled page to a separate file with respective names.
so we can easily setup navigation between pages. as nextjs routing mechanism.

then we will process each file with gpt and generate a new page.tsx file.
autogenerate layout.tsx for each page.tsx file.

notes:
remove duplicates, sometimes crawler will crawl the same page multiple times.
