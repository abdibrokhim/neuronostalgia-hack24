Here's the JSON data that i scrape from internet. My current task is make a function or functions that will do the required job: 

1) layoutGenerator that will generate "layout.tsx" inside each folder. simply reads the contents from "layout.txt" file then writes to "layout.tsx". 1.1.) "layout.tsx" title and description should be updated based on the scraped JSON data. for example: "title": "Fellow Membership", "description": "Our association's impact ... etc.",
2) function that will create all the required folders. folder names should be exactly similar to the endpoints: everything that comes next this URL: "https://www.raptors.dev/<folder_name>". for example: "url": "https://www.raptors.dev/fellow-membership", here's folder_name="fellow-membership".
3) function that will create "page.tsx" inside each folder gets string as an argument.
4) make sure implement everything inside "page.tsx" to avoid any errors and issues during running process "npm run dev".
5) make a function that finds markdown and returns it.

Okay, the logic is very simple: we will firstly scrape the data and save in JSON file. Then we will generate folder names and track them in map (dictionary). Then we will go throw each and generate "layout.tsx" and save inside each folder. Then we will read markdown and pass to the "chatCompletion()" function to get the 90s styled website NextJS in string format and return it . Returned text we will pass to another function that will write inside "page.tsx" file and saves inside specific folder. Then we will loop the process till we read all markdown from JSON scraped data. 

As we done with everything we should get the full functional Multi page website. the name of the parent folder is : "demo" and everything will be places inside it. for example: 

demo/ (folder_name)
--layout.tsx (file_name)
--page.tsx (file_name)
--fellow-membership/ (folder_name)
----layout.tsx (file_name)
----page.tsx (file_name)
--leadership-principles/ (folder_name)
----layout.tsx (file_name)
----page.tsx (file_name)
--our-members/ (folder_name)
----layout.tsx (file_name)
----page.tsx (file_name)
--blog/ (folder_name)
----layout.tsx (file_name)
----page.tsx (file_name)
--project/ (folder_name)
----layout.tsx (file_name)
----page.tsx (file_name)

etc.
